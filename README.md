# Predicting Life Expectancy for Developing Countries
### STAT 4310 Applied Regression

The goal of this project aims to determine which various predicting variables really affect the life expectancy in developing countries. Using this information, a multiple linear regression model can then be established to predict life expectancy in developing countries based on these appropriate factors. Additionally, we can answer key questions, such as: Could a country with a lower life expectancy increase itâ€™s health care expenditure in order to improve its average lifespan? How do infant and adult mortality rates affect life expectancy? What impact does schooling have on life expectancy, if any? Is there a positive correlation with immunizations and life expectancy? Do densely populated countries tend to have lower life expectancy? Does Life Expectancy has positive or negative correlation with eating habits, lifestyle, exercise, smoking, drinking alcohol etc. By analyzing these various coefficient estimates, we can hopefully provide insight to these meaningful questions.
